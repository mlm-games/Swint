Multiplatform Matrix client

It uses a Rust library built on top of matrix-sdk for the core Matrix
functionality and a Compose Multiplatform UI for Android and desktop.

Current capabilities:
- room list with basic previews and unread counts
- room and thread timelines (text and media)
- end-to-end encryption (via matrix-sdk)
- spaces view
- basic presence and privacy settings

This app is not intended as a feature-complete client with breezily fast updates (nor is trying to cover all features of matrix). 
Currently use a lot of alpha/beta deps which may take time to become stable.

Do donate if you like (not going to put it in app, wouldn't be here too but need some justification for me or my SOs)
